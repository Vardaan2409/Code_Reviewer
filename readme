# Code Reviewer Backend

This project is a backend service for a code reviewer application. It uses Node.js and Express to provide a server that can handle HTTP requests and responses. The service includes functionality for reviewing JavaScript code snippets and providing feedback.

## Features

- **Code Review**: The backend can review JavaScript code snippets and provide feedback on potential issues and improvements.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `dotenv` to manage environment variables.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Enabled to allow requests from different origins.
- **Google Generative AI**: Integrates with Google's generative AI for advanced code analysis.

## Project Structure

- **server.js**: The entry point of the application. It starts the server on port 3000.
- **src/app.js**: Contains the main application logic (not shown in the provided files).
- **temp.js**: Contains a sample `sum` function that needs improvement.
- **temp.md**: Contains a detailed review and suggestions for improving the `sum` function in `temp.js`.
- **package.json**: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- **.env**: Stores environment variables, such as the Google Gemini API key.

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
2. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY`).
3. **Start the Server**: Run `node server.js` to start the server. The server will listen on port 3000.

## Example Usage

- **Review Code**: Send a JavaScript code snippet to the backend, and it will return feedback on potential issues and improvements.
- **Sum Function**: The `temp.js` file contains a simple `sum` function that can be improved based on the suggestions in `temp.md`.

## Dependencies

- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **cors**: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- **@google/generative-ai**: Integrates with Google's generative AI for advanced code analysis.
